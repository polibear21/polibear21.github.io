                <p class="text-muted mb-0">On April 23rd, 2022, the Chinese American Association of Lexington (CAAL)
                    Youth
                    STEM Team sent 3 representatives–Baoren Liu, David Zhao, and William Zhang–to showcase the
                    organization’s
                    past and ongoing civic service projects and initiatives to compete for a helpful grant offered by
                    the
                    Emerging Leaders in Civic Action Mini-Grant Pitching Event. The event was organized by the <a
                        href="https://www.nclacademy.org/" target="_blank">Civic Leadership Academy</a>
                    , a national organization dedicated towards fostering passionate young
                    leaders to design and run community initiatives centered around the principles of civic engagement
                    and
                    community reformations. The grant included an initial seed fund of $500, mentor-led workshops on
                    6/25/2022,
                    7/23/2022, and 8/20/2022, along with additional guidance and leadership development training
                    sessions. Our
                    team was also invited to showcase our completed projects in the Annual Emerging Leaders in Civic
                    Action
                    Showcase event (in collaboration with the United Chinese Americans, or <a href="https://ucausa.org/"
                        target="_blank">UCA</a>) from July 14-16, 2022.
                        <br><br>
                        Here are the slides we presented in the competition: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TtKvfLGBHQKsAJv9c1w6QUHX5C7PVk1O7agieTLd6c4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TtKvfLGBHQKsAJv9c1w6QUHX5C7PVk1O7agieTLd6c4/edit?usp=sharing</a>

                <h4 class="text-center mt-0">Preparation</h4>
                <hr />
                <p class="text-muted mb-0">Preparation for the presentation began in early February of 2022, when the
                    team met together numerous times to devise optimal pre-screening round application paragraphs
                    for the subteams’ various community impact-based projects. This was followed by preparation of a set
                    of slides to showcase the team’s accomplishments and ongoing initiatives, highlighting the following
                    projects:<br><br>

                <ul class="dashed mb-0">

                    <li><b> Rediscovering Lexington’s Heroes</b> <i>(In collaboration with the Lexington Town
                            Government)</i>
                    </li>

                    <li><b> Spoken Wise</b> <i>(In collaboration with the Lexington Cary Memorial Library)</i></li>

                    <li><b> Lunar Arts Website Restoration</b> <i>(In collaboration with New Moon
                            International)</i><br><br></li>


                </ul>

                <p class="text-muted mb-0">The team also decided on a split-project presentation format, opening up with
                    a brief overview
                    of all the initiatives organized by the subteams of the CAAL Youth STEM Team organization.</p>

                <p class="text-muted mb-0">This was subsequently added on by detailed slides explaining the actionable
                    steps taken and planned by each individual subteam on their respective projects, along with the
                    overarching objectives of the respective subteams on their community impact-centered projects.</p>

                <p class="text-muted mb-0">The prepared slides and showcase section concluded with a riveting
                    description of how the projects would impact the community, and the presenting members all explained
                    how the grant funds and mentorship/leadership training sessions would help them further their
                    ambitious community reformation goals.

                <h4 class="text-center mt-0">Presentation (and Awards)</h4>
                <hr />
                <p class="text-muted mb-0">
                    Presentation day, as always, was intensive and fast-paced, with the judges asking difficult
                    questions for the team to answer and explain their well-planned solutions to. There were
                    numerous good points raised by the grant application judges in the presentations given by
                    all teams to ensure a rigorously decided result for the grant award and placements.
                    At the end of the presentation, David, Baoren, and William all believed that the CAAL Youth
                    STEM Team showcased the full extent of their community outreach projects and their outstanding
                    applications of
                    various software development skill sets in creating change and reformation in their community.
                    A few weeks later, results were released for the Emerging Leaders in Civic Action Mini-Grant
                    Pitching Event.

                    The CAAL Youth STEM Team had won the 1st place award in the placements, and had
                    become the recipient of the 2022 Emerging Leaders in Civic Action Grant, enabling the
                    organization to
                    further its initiatives in utilizing the technologies of the information age to build
                    extraordinary tools
                    to help improve the community of Lexington and beyond. We would like to extend its thanks to
                    the Civic
                    Leadership Academy and its affiliates for providing this unique opportunity for the CAAL
                    Youth STEM Team,
                    and hope that this opportunity will help us aid the community even further in providing
                    digital solutions
                    to various public works initiatives of the team.

                <p class="text-muted mb-0">The Lexington Youth STEM Team participated in the 2022 Patriots Day Parade
                    with
                    the aim of spreading their contributions to the community. David Zhao, Cassidy Xu and Ashley Zhang
                    helped hold advertising banners for local businesses, while William Zhang and Kevin Zhu volunteered
                    to
                    hold the CAAL banner. Irene Gao and Ethan Shao proudly held the team’s poster. The atmosphere was
                    lively
                    and invigorating as the STEM Team and other members of CAAL were showered with applause from the
                    audience. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-muted mb-0">The team lead for this activity was Ivy Tang, who communicated with the team
                    and
                    designed the team poster with the help of her friend Hannah Guo. They incorporated aspects of the
                    American flag in the poster, and added names of the team’s past projects in flowers along with a
                    computer. This symbolized the blooming of contributions to the community with the aid of technology.
                    Ultimately, the team was able to successfully publicize themselves and convey the hard work of each
                    member.<br><br></p>
