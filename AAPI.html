                            A group of Lexington High School students led by Grace Ou organized four events for each week of June for the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community to
                            celebrate and share their culture with others. Each week focused on a different aspect of culture. The first week focused on the history of AAPI culture and what life
                            was like integrating into American culture. This was showcased through the award winning movie: Far East Deep South. The second week focused on AAPI art. These were
                            submitted by residents in and around Lexington which were then showcased in Cary Memorial Library and the website's online art gallery. The third week focused on food,
                            which culminated in a collection of AAPI recipes which were sold in a cookbook. A food panel was also hosted at Cary Memorial Library which discussed how food and
                            cultural identity are closely related. The last week of June was a celebration of AAPI culture, where a 5K run ‘n walk was hosted.<br />

                            We made a <a href="http://aapimonth.caal-ma.org/index.html">website</a> to create a central hub of information for people to understand what, where, and when events are
                            being hosted. In our design of the website we broke it down in a timeline with each week corresponding to a different page to make it an easy, navigable, and fun
                            experience to explore the site.

                            Throughout the month of June it was an amazing success! From the food panel to the 5K Run ‘n Walk there were hundreds of participants. The AAPI website ended up getting
                            around 3,500 page views all over the world! Visits ranged from India and China to towns in and around Lexington.<br /><br />Overall, our team was excited to be a part
                            of an important celebration of culture! We were excited to see the impact and outreach our site was able to get, and see the views convert to astounding turnouts to the
                            live events.
