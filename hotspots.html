                        </h3>

                        <p class="mb-2" style="font-size: 20px;">
                            Lexington, MA is a town with many historic landmarks and enjoyable events such as the famous
                            Patriots' Day parade. Unfortunately, Patriots' Day had to be virtual in 2021 due to COVID-19.
                            The Lexington Town Governmentâ€™s Celebration committee reached out to our coding team; they
                            wanted us to create a website with virtual events for people to have fun in despite the
                            pandemic. Our website allowed residents to participate in multiple activities including
                            taking photos in front of historical locations. These monuments were popular and visited
                            very frequently during the event. Please check the <a href="patriots.html">Patriots' Day project page</a> for more
                            detail. Another major activity of the parade was that participants could mark their location
                            on a GPS based map system for each of the monuments they visited. This helped our team
                            collect data for future use, and inspired the Hotspots project.

                            <u><br>What We Did</u>
                        </h3>

                        <p class="mb-2" style="font-size: 20px;">
                            In this Hotspots project, we planned on developing a machine learning algorithm that could
                            successfully analyze data from the 2021 Patriots' Day parade. Our team learned the Weka API
                            and planned to code the final result in Java. The ultimate goal was to publish a research
                            paper of our findings and improve the virtual parade for the future. However, we disbanded
                            this project in March 2022 when the Lexington government announced their Patriots Day' parade
                            would return in person. Also, co-leader Gabriel Sui got accepted to the University of
                            Oxford, England and eventually graduated our team! Instead, our team joined other ongoing
                            projects to continue helping our town!

                        <p class="mb-2" style="font-size: 20px;">
                            In this project, our group analyzed data collected from the 2021 virtual Patriots' Day
                            parade to search for patterns that could improve the event in the future. Civic engagement
                            is promoted through this event by building a sense of community, giving citizens an
                            opportunity to go outside and visit town landmarks inspiring a sense of pride for the rich
                            heritage of the town. Since many Lexington citizens had minimized social contact and
                            isolated themselves during the pandemic, the Patriots' Day event also promoted taking a nice
                            walk, run or bike ride with friends and family. The Hotspots data planned to enhance the
                            event and encourage future engagement, further benefiting our community!
